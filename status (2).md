#### What have you done for your project so far?

Currently working on creating the maze, it is difficult to currently work on displaying the maze.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Player movement and parts of the maze changer bits.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I’m having a hard time creating the maze. I was wondering if there was an easier way to create a maze rather than just figuring things out on my own. I don’t want to copy others’ work, but can I reference them as a source of how I created the maze?
