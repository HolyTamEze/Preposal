# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Ever-Changing Maze

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

It is a game that changes the maze’s layout every move the player makes.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This project’s goal is to escape the maze while making the layout of the maze different than before. First off, the software will generate a maze and position the player, marked with a red turtle, on the top left of the maze. Their goal is to simply exit the maze. There is one feature I will implement in the maze. The feature is randomizing the maze in either 2, 3, or 4 parts of the maze. This will be executed when the player is asked if they want this feature or not by saying “yes” or “no”. 

When the game starts, the player can move in any direction except when there is a wall blocking it. The player can input the direction by typing “left”, “right”, “up”, or “down”, and the player will move with the input given. If the player inputs anything else, they will be prompt to enter again until the player has chosen one of the four moves. If the player enters one of the four words, but there is a wall blocking it, the player will be able to type another word. After the player gives the input, the turtle will move in the direction of your word. 

The feature that I mentioned will be said here. After the turtle moves, the feature will activate and execute a number of random parts of the maze. This  feature allows to have either 2, 3, or 4 pieces moved, depending on what the player has inputted. For every move the player makes, 2 random pieces will be switched and placed. Say 4 pieces are randomly picked, those four pieces are switched with 4 other random pieces. The player has to get out of the maze while dealing with a changing maze.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

None

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

None

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Creating the maze is something I will accomplish no matter what.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Moving the turtle by user input and knowing when to prompt the user again is something that I think I can accomplish.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Changing the layout of the maze for every move is something I hope to accomplish.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps for this project will be starting to code the layout of the maze and testing my code to see if the layout of the maze is created. That is basically the main foundation of the game. If I believe that the layout of the maze is good enough, I will start working on getting the input from the player for the turtle to move. I will also need to prompt the user to enter another word if the user puts in the wrong word or something is obstructing the turtle. With these two in mind, this will be a normal maze with no features attached to it yet. However, that will be my main goal if I can’t get to randomly switching the parts of the maze.
